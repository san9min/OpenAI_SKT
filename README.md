**[Demo Page](https://audrey.kr/)**  

We are developing an AI-powered online research tool aimed at streamlining repetitive and time-consuming tasks in online data research. Our goal is to enable individuals to focus on more important tasks by harnessing the capabilities of generative AI technology.

We plan to start by collecting data from reputable sources such as **[통계청](https://kostat.go.kr)** and **[정책 브리핑](http://www.korea.kr)**, and then establish partnerships with other data-rich websites to expand our dataset. This will allow us to provide valuable and reliable information for research purposes.

Our tool will be versatile, capable of handling a wide range of data formats, including web pages, PDF documents, YouTube videos, and even audio content. This flexibility ensures that users can extract information from diverse sources efficiently.

To make our tool even more user-friendly and productive, we will implement an autonomous agent that can understand and execute user commands effectively. This agent will serve as a valuable assistant, helping users navigate and extract information from the vast pool of data available online.

In summary, our AI-powered online research tool aims to enhance the productivity and efficiency of data research by automating repetitive tasks, providing access to reliable data sources, and incorporating an autonomous agent to assist users in their research endeavors.
